# Favicon

## Usage
Looking for a company logo? Just fetch it from `https://favicon.twenty.com/company.com`
For example, if you're looking to display the Apple logo on your website, you can use: `<img src="https://favicon.twenty.com/apple.com" alt="Logo" />`

# Example
There are many other use-cases, mostly for B2B companies.
For example if you are a SaaS you could look at the domain when someone signups and automatically set their workspace logo based on that.

In our case, we built it because we needed it for our CRM [Twenty](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty):
